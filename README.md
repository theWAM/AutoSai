# AutoSai v0.0.1
Set of python programs that listen for and log mouse activity via the pynput library and save Paint Tool SAI files using the pyautogui library. Meant to imitate the autosave function of programs such as Photoshop and Google Docs.

## Limitations
- As of right now, I have my location for sai hard coded in the pyautotest.py, so the program won't work elsewhere without changing the code.
- The repository lacks an exe file and it is imperative that python, pynput, and pyautogui are installed before use.
